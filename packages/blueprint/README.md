# Blueprint

Welcome to your custom UVerify UI template! This is a starting point for building your own user interface for the UVerify platform.

## Getting Started

As this is a standard React app, you can run the following commands to get started:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Customizing the UI

### Template Class

Once your app is up and running, youâ€™ll see an example certificate rendered by default. This serves as your starting point for creating a custom UI. To begin customizing, open the `src/Certificate.tsx` file in your code editor and make the necessary adjustments.

While the other files in this directory support your development environment, UVerify will only import the `Certificate.tsx` file.

### Render Function

A UVerify UI template is an implementation of the UVerify template interface. The main interaction point is the `render` function.

```typescript
  public abstract render(
    hash: string,
    metadata: UVerifyMetadata,
    certificate: UVerifyCertificate | undefined,
    pagination: JSX.Element,
    extra: UVerifyCertificateExtraData
  ): JSX.Element;
```

You can implement your custom logic and UI elements that fit your branding and user experience. UVerify will provide the necessary data through the parameters.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `hash` | `string` | The hash of the certificate being verified. |
| `metadata` | `Object` | The on-chain metadata which has been provided during the certificate creation |
| `certificate` | `UVerifyCertificate | undefined` | The certificate being verified, or `undefined` if not available. |
| `pagination` | `JSX.Element` | Pagination controls for navigating through multiple certificates. |
| `extra` | `UVerifyCertificateExtraData` | Additional data related to the certificate e.g. whether it has been hashed multiple times, server error status, and loading state. |

```typescript
declare interface UVerifyCertificate {
  hash: string;
  address: string;
  blockHash: string;
  blockNumber: number;
  transactionHash: string;
  slot: number;
  creationTime: number;
  metadata: string;
  issuer: string;
}

type UVerifyCertificateExtraData = {
  hashedMultipleTimes: boolean;
  firstDateTime: string;
  issuer: string;
  serverError: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
};
```

### Theming

You can use custom colors and styles to match your branding, a color or gradient background, and customize the (default) footer visibility.

```typescript
type ThemeSettings = {
  background: string;
  colors: Colors;
  components: Components;
  footer: {
    hide: boolean;
  };
};
```

To override the default theme, just add `public theme: Partial<ThemeSettings> = { ... }` to your class. You can specify any of the properties in the `ThemeSettings` type.

### Whitelist Addresses

You can specify a list of whitelisted addresses that are allowed to use this template. If a non-whitelisted address would push a UVerify certificate, using the template id of this template, it wouldn't be rendered as a standard UVerify certificate, as the UVerify ui is doing an issuer check before rendering the certificate. This is useful for custom templates that should only be used by specific addresses.

```typescript
// An empty whitelist allows all addresses to use this template.
public whitelist = [
  'addr1qyleluql6elu7sktvncqfufnq675hlt9z922ah9sm45dmp7kjn0vsay0vq28379mczjmglmam3svuxyka0tyw0uchwjqmxmhg3',
  'addr_test1qqleluql6elu7sktvncqfufnq675hlt9z922ah9sm45dmp7kjn0vsay0vq28379mczjmglmam3svuxyka0tyw0uchwjqcsxhyw',
];
```
